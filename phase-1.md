# Phase 1: Core Functionality - Implementation Steps

## Step 1: Backend Foundation Setup
**Goal**: Set up the basic backend structure with database and API framework

### 1.1 Project Structure & Dependencies
- Initialize Bun project with TypeScript
- Install core dependencies (Hono, better-sqlite3, Sharp, Replicate SDK)
- Set up project directory structure
- Configure TypeScript and development scripts

### 1.2 Database Setup
- Create SQLite database schema
- Implement database connection and basic operations
- Set up migrations system
- Create database service with type-safe operations

### 1.3 Basic API Framework
- Set up Hono server with middleware (CORS, error handling)
- Create route structure (sessions, batches, images, upload)
- Implement basic health check endpoint
- Set up file upload middleware

**Deliverable**: Working backend server that can start and handle basic requests

## Step 2: Replicate Integration
**Goal**: Connect to Google's Nano Banana model via Replicate API

### 2.1 Replicate Service Setup
- Configure Replicate SDK with API key
- Implement image generation service
- Set up polling mechanism for generation status
- Handle error cases and retries

### 2.2 File Management System
- Create file storage structure (uploads/, generated/full/, generated/previews/)
- Implement reference image upload handling
- Set up temporary file cleanup
- Create image processing pipeline with Sharp

### 2.3 Generation Pipeline
- Implement batch creation and processing
- Connect generation service to database
- Set up status tracking and updates
- Handle generated image download and storage

**Deliverable**: Backend can receive prompts, generate images via Replicate, and store results

---

## Step 3: Core API Endpoints
**Goal**: Implement the essential API endpoints for the frontend

### 3.1 Session Management APIs
- `POST /api/sessions` - Create new session
- `GET /api/sessions` - List all sessions
- `GET /api/sessions/:sessionId` - Get session details

### 3.2 Batch Generation APIs
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/batches` - Create new generation batch
- `GET /api/batches/:batchId/status` - Get batch status and results

### 3.3 Image Serving APIs
- `GET /api/images/:filename` - Serve full resolution images
- `GET /api/images/preview/:filename` - Serve preview images
- `POST /api/upload/reference` - Handle reference image uploads

**Deliverable**: Complete API that frontend can consume for core functionality

---

## Step 4: Frontend Foundation
**Goal**: Set up React frontend with basic navigation and state management

### 4.1 React Project Setup
- Initialize React project with TypeScript and Vite
- Install dependencies (Tailwind CSS, React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand)
- Configure Tailwind with mobile-first approach
- Set up basic project structure

### 4.2 Core Components & Routing
- Create main layout component with navigation
- Set up React Router with core routes (/, /sessions, /gallery)
- Implement basic screen components (Home, Sessions, Gallery)
- Create shared UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)

### 4.3 State Management Setup
- Configure TanStack Query for server state
- Set up Zustand store for local state
- Create API client with proper error handling
- Implement basic data fetching hooks

**Deliverable**: Working React app with navigation between screens

---

## Step 5: Home Screen Generation Interface
**Goal**: Build the core image generation interface

### 5.1 Session Management UI
- Session selector dropdown
- "New Session" creation flow
- Current session display and switching
- Session state persistence

### 5.2 Generation Form
- Mobile-optimized prompt textarea
- Reference image upload with drag/drop
- Batch size selector (slider 1-8)
- Form validation and error handling

### 5.3 Generation Process
- Generate button with loading states
- Progress tracking and display
- Real-time status updates
- Error handling and retry options

**Deliverable**: Functional home screen that can create sessions and generate images

---

## Step 6: Image Display & Modal
**Goal**: Display generated images with full-screen viewing

### 6.1 Image Grid Component
- Responsive grid layout for generated images
- Lazy loading with intersection observer
- Preview image loading with fallbacks
- Touch-friendly interaction

### 6.2 Recent Batches Display
- Show last 2-3 batches on home screen
- Batch cards with thumbnails
- Status indicators (pending, completed, failed)
- Navigation to full batch view

### 6.3 Full-Screen Image Modal
- Modal overlay with full-size image
- Image metadata display (prompt, session, etc.)
- Basic actions (download, close)
- Mobile-optimized touch interactions

**Deliverable**: Complete image viewing experience with modal and basic actions

---

## Integration & Testing
**Goal**: Ensure all components work together smoothly

### Integration Tasks
- Connect frontend generation form to backend API
- Implement real-time status updates
- Test error handling across the stack
- Verify image upload and display pipeline
- Mobile responsiveness testing

### Success Criteria
- User can create a session
- User can enter prompt and generate images
- Images appear in real-time as they complete
- User can view images in full-screen modal
- Error states are handled gracefully
- App works well on mobile devices
