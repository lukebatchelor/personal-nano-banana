# Phase 2: Reference Images & Session Management - Implementation Steps

## Overview
Building on Phase 1's core functionality, Phase 2 focuses on reference image upload with Replicate API integration, comprehensive session management, and enhanced user experience.

## Replicate API Test Results
**Successful test upload response:**
```json
{
  "id": "NWZmNDA0NGMtNThkMS00YTFmLWFjZjctNzY1ZGJiODdjYzc2",
  "name": "test-reference.jpg",
  "content_type": "image/jpeg", 
  "size": 227406,
  "checksums": {
    "sha256": "a04beca87889cf1ccc95af0d4680a6b43f75253c0f1f7fe519f3705dcbede397",
    "md5": "530c4aab5768ef11aa8b16374e95c8a6"

## Step 1: Reference Image Upload & Reuse Architecture
**Goal**: Implement efficient reference image handling with Replicate API integration

### 1.1 Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Internal reference image tracking (user's uploaded files)
CREATE TABLE reference_images (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,              -- Our local filename
    original_name TEXT,                  -- User's original filename
    file_hash_sha256 TEXT UNIQUE,        -- SHA-256 hash for deduplication
    content_type TEXT,                   -- image/jpeg, image/png, etc.
    file_size INTEGER,                   -- File size in bytes
    uploaded_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Replicate upload tracking (expires every 24hrs)
CREATE TABLE uploaded_reference_images (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    reference_image_id INTEGER REFERENCES reference_images(id),
    replicate_file_id TEXT NOT NULL,     -- ID from Replicate response
    replicate_expires_at DATETIME,       -- When Replicate file expires (24hrs)
    uploaded_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    replicate_metadata TEXT              -- JSON metadata from Replicate
);

-- Update batch_reference_images to reference our internal table
ALTER TABLE batch_reference_images ADD COLUMN reference_image_id INTEGER REFERENCES reference_images(id);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_reference_images_hash ON reference_images(file_hash_sha256);
CREATE INDEX idx_uploaded_ref_expires ON uploaded_reference_images(replicate_expires_at);
```

### 1.2 Reference Image Service
- **File deduplication**: SHA-256 hash-based detection to avoid duplicate storage
- **Replicate upload API**: POST to `/v1/files` with proper error handling
- **URL construction**: Build URLs from stored file_id: `https://api.replicate.com/v1/files/{file_id}`
- **Expiration handling**: Re-upload to Replicate only when reusing expired files
- **Internal persistence**: Keep all reference images permanently in local storage

### 1.3 Batch Processing Updates
- **Pre-upload phase**: Check for existing internal reference images by hash
- **Replicate validation**: Check if valid Replicate upload exists for reused images
- **Silent re-upload**: Re-upload expired files to Replicate transparently during batch creation
- **URL substitution**: Use fresh Replicate URLs in prediction requests
- **Batch tracking**: Store reference to internal reference_image_id

### 1.4 File Persistence Strategy
- **Permanent storage**: Never delete reference images from local storage
- **Silent re-upload**: Re-upload to Replicate only when needed for batch processing
- **No user notifications**: Handle expiration/re-upload transparently
- **Simple reuse**: Previous batches always available for reference image reuse

**Deliverable**: Simple, transparent reference image system

## Reference Image Architecture Implementation Details

### Upload & Deduplication Flow
1. **File Selection**: User selects reference images in frontend
2. **Client-side hashing**: Calculate SHA-256 hash of each file
3. **Duplicate check**: Query database for existing hashes
4. **Upload new files**: Send unique files to Replicate `/v1/files` endpoint
5. **Store metadata**: Save Replicate response (id, checksums, expiration) locally
6. **Batch creation**: Use Replicate URLs (`https://api.replicate.com/v1/files/{id}`) in predictions

### Reuse & Expiration Handling Flow
1. **Load batch history**: Display reference images with expiration status
2. **User selection**: Click "Reuse these reference images"
3. **Expiration check**: Validate if Replicate files are still valid (< 20hrs old)
4. **Auto-refresh expired**: Re-upload expired files transparently to user
5. **Form population**: Add valid/refreshed reference image URLs to generation form
6. **Status feedback**: Show user which images were refreshed with success/failure indicators

### Data Storage Strategy
```javascript
// Example database records after Replicate upload
uploaded_reference_images: {
  id: 1,
  filename: "1757130133_17b775c8-56244661.jpg",
  replicate_file_id: "NWZmNDA0NGMtNThkMS00YTFmLWFjZjctNzY1ZGJiODdjYzc2", 
  replicate_expires_at: "2025-09-07T04:04:16.162Z",
  file_hash_sha256: "a04beca87889cf1ccc95af0d4680a6b43f75253c0f1f7fe519f3705dcbede397",
  usage_count: 3
}

// Helper function to construct Replicate URL
function getReplicateURL(fileId) {
  return `https://api.replicate.com/v1/files/${fileId}`;
}
```

### Expiration Management
- **Grace period**: Re-upload files older than 20 hours (4-hour safety buffer)
- **Background refresh**: Scheduled job to refresh frequently used reference images
- **User notifications**: Alert when reference images need attention
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when reference images unavailable
